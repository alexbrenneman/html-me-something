          <h3 class="from-february">From February</h3>

          <p>Alex was born in a small town in Pennsylvania called Somerset on February 21st 1992. He was raised just across the 
            Pennsylvania, Maryland border, in Grantsville Maryland. As a child Alex was intrigued with sports, mainly basketball.
            Some say he could dribble a basketball from the day he was able to walk. As Alex got older his  
            interests began to change toward more "extreme" sports. When Alex turned 14 his parents (David and Laverna Brenneman)
            took Alex to get his very first dirtbike. It wasn't long before Alex was riding all over his small town and
            learning to jump his new toy. </p>

            <h3 class="14-20">First Ride</h3>

            <p>Alex continued to ride his new dirtbike until he outgew the small Honda crf100. By this time his interests
                had begun to change again, this time to cars. Alex loved every aspect of cars. The speed, the size, and most 
                importantly the freedom that came along with it. He began to save for a car at age 15 by working for his dad and 
                eventually getting his first job in a metal fabrication shop. He learned a lot of  useful skills working at that job.
                Alex's main duties were not glamorous by any means. He spent most of his day sweeping the floors and doing the 
                yard work. Finally after about  a year and a half of saving his money Alex bought his first car: a 1999 Pontiac 
                Sunfire.

           <h3 class="the-wreck">The Wreck</h3>

           <p>Alex had that car for another 2 years before he needed to get a new car. About 3 weeks after purchasing his 
               new car, Alex decided it would be fun to show off to some friends how "good" he was at 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)"target="_blank">drifting</a> his car. It didn't take long before 
                he relized he had made a very big mistake. As he was sliding, he lost control of the car and went careening into 
            a lagre tree. Alex was quoted as saying "I watched as time slowed down to a crawl. When the car hit the tree I could 
            see the hood buckel and then watched as the air bags deployed". Luckily everyone in the car was totally fine.
